# Iterating through list elements
{:.collapse-trigger}

	for item in list:
		print('List item: ', item)
		
It is not necessary to iterate list items via their position.
You _rarely_ need to do:

	for i in range(len(list)):
		print('List item: ', list[i])

		
# Iterating through a dictionary
{:.collapse-trigger}

	for key in dictionary:
		print('Key item: ', key)

Same as

	for key in dictionary.keys():
		print('Key item: ', key)

For the values only

	for v in dictionary.values():
		print('Value item: ', v)

For both keys and values

	for k,v in dictionary.items():
		print('Key item :', k, ' | Value item: ', v)

# Read a file line by line
{:.collapse-trigger}

	with open("filename","r") as f:
		for line in f:
			print('Line: ', line)

The `with` statement takes care of closing the file in case an error occurs in the `for` loop.

# Defining a function with position or named arguments
{:.collapse-trigger}

	def functionName(arg1, arg2, arg3=None, arg4='', arg5=0):
		# body of the function

`arg1` and `arg2` are positioned arguments, required when calling the function.

`arg3`, `arg4`, `arg5` are named arguments with a default value (respectively `None`, the empty string, and the interger `0`)

# Importing a function from a module
{:.collapse-trigger}

	from moduleName import functionName

Or if we want to _rename_ locally the function:

	from moduleName import functionName as newName


# Testing a condition
{:.collapse-trigger}

We need boolean logic to compare values. We have of course < >, <=, >=, to compare integers, floats or even strings.
If we compare objects, Python will compare their size (by calling `__len__()`).

The comparator `==` and `!=` checks the _values_, while `is` checks
the id (ie _are the same object?_). Obviously, when `v1 is v2`, it
implies `v1 == v2`.

A condition can combine expressions with the above comparators, using
the logical `and` and `or` operators, and `not condition` is its
negation.


	if condition:
		print('Condition is true')
	else:
		print('Condition is false')

We can pass an object as the condition. This is very convenient as Python will check if the object is "False".

False objects are:

* the keywords `None`, `False`,
* the values `0`, `0.0`,
* the empty string `''`,
* the empty list `[]`, the empty tuple `()`
* the empty dictionary `{}`, 

If you define your own class, you'll have to add the function
`__bool__()` (or `__len__()`, since Python defaults to `__len__` when
`__bool__` is not present)

For example, when calling a function where arguments have default values

	def functionName(arg1=None):
		
		if arg1:
			print('arg1 was None')
		
		# Body of the function
	  
# Catching errors
{:.collapse-trigger}

	try:
		#
		# Do something
		#
		
	except ErrorName:
		print("An error of type ErrorName occured")
		
	print('Continue after the error')
