# Description

This course provides a practical introduction to the writing
of [Python](https://www.python.org/) programs for the complete
novice. Participants are lead through the core aspects of Python
illustrated by a series of example programs. Upon completion of the
course, attentive participants will be able to write simple Python
programs from scratch and to customize more complex code to fit their
needs.

# Important Dates

* Application open: November 2nd, 2016

# Audience and Prerequisites

* The course is suitable for complete beginners and assumes no prior
  programming experience (beyond the ability to use a text editor).
* A very basic knowledge of UNIX would be an advantage, such as
  navigating through folders and issuing commands at a shell
  prompt. We will not teach Unix in detail: Other course are available
  at SciLifeLab for it.
* Bring your own laptop (Linux, or Mac) for the practical
  exercises. Otherwise, please contact us at
  education@scilifelab.uu.se before you apply.

# Course Content

During this course, you will learn about:

* Core concepts about Python syntax: Data types, blocks and indentation, variable scoping, iteration, functions, methods and arguments
* Different ways to control program flow using loops and conditional tests
* Regular expressions and pattern matching
* Writing functions and best-practice ways of making them usable
* Reading from and writing to files
* Code packaging and Python libraries
* How to work with biological data using external libraries.

# Learning Objectives

After this course you should be able to:

* Edit and run Python code
* Write file-processing python programs that produce output to the terminal and/or external files.
* Create stand-alone python programs to process biological data
* Know how to develop your skills in Python after the course (including debugging)

# Format

* Presentations and demonstrations
* Practical exercises (either in the lab with assistants or on your own).

Main teacher: [Frédéric Haziza](http://nbis.se/staff/frederic-haziza/)

Prior to the course, you can read a companion
book
["Programming Python"](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596158118.do),
or
["Learning Python"](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028154.do). Such
a book will also prove useful for your programming tasks, after the
course is over. It is however not required, and material will be
presented in class.
