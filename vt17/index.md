# Description

This course provides a practical introduction to the writing
of [Python](https://www.python.org/) programs for the complete
novice. Participants are lead through the core aspects of Python
illustrated by a series of example programs. Upon completion of the
course, attentive participants will be able to write simple Python
programs from scratch and to customize more complex code to fit their
needs.

* The course is suitable for complete beginners and assumes no prior
  programming experience (beyond the ability to use a text editor).
* A very basic knowledge of UNIX would be an advantage, such as
  navigating through folders and issuing commands at a shell
  prompt. We will not teach Unix in detail: Other course are available
  at SciLifeLab for it.

    > Before the first lecture, we require you to follow
    > these [preliminary steps](preliminary).

# Schedule

From Monday February 6<sup>th</sup>, to Friday February 10<sup>th</sup> 2017 (week 6).

* 09:00 - 12:00: Lectures + Hands-on (including a Fika break)
* 12.00 - 13:00: Lunch
* 13:00 - 15:00: Lectures + Hands-on
* 15:00 - 17:00: Practice time (with assistants)

# Course Content

During this course, you will learn about:

* Core concepts about Python syntax: Data types, blocks and indentation, variable scoping, iteration, functions, methods and arguments
* Different ways to control program flow using loops and conditional tests
* Regular expressions and pattern matching
* Writing functions and best-practice ways of making them usable
* Reading from and writing to files
* Code packaging and Python libraries
* How to work with biological data using external libraries.

# Learning Outcomes

After this course you should be able to:

* Edit and run Python code
* Write file-processing python programs that produce output to the terminal and/or external files.
* Create stand-alone python programs to process biological data
* Know how to develop your skills in Python after the course (including debugging)

### Learning objectives (ie goals for the teachers)

* Increase the student's toolbelt for better quality and performance at work
* Make students understand that there is more to programming than only
  _knowing_ the syntax of a language. <br/>The craft of programming is
  about taking design decisions to avoid overwhelming complexity and
  permit easy maintenance over time, insuring reliability (which goes
  beyond debugging) and utilizing computer resources efficiently. <br/>
  This design expertise is precisely what [NBIS](https://nbis.se) provides.

# Format

* Presentations and demonstrations
* Practical exercises (either as lab assignments with assistants or on your own).

We do not require you to buy a companion book, as there are already
lots of resources online. However, if you insist, here are some
suggestions:

* ["Programming Python"](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596158118.do),
* ["Learning Python"](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028154.do), and
* [Programming in Python 3](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Python-Complete-Introduction-Language/dp/0321680561)

Such a book can prove useful for your programming tasks, even after the
course is over.

# Location

Lectures and exercises will take place in room `E10:1309` at

Uppsala Biomedical Centre (BMC), Husargatan 3, SciLifeLab entrance (C11).
