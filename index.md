[NBIS](//nbis.se) offers practical courses
in [Python](//www.python.org/) programming for the complete novice, to
the more advanced users. Participants are led through the core aspects
of Python illustrated by a series of example programs.

> There is more to programming than only _knowing_ the syntax of a
> language. The craft of programming is about taking design decisions
> to avoid overwhelming complexity and permit easy maintenance over
> time, insuring reliability (which goes beyond debugging) and
> utilizing computer resources efficiently.

This is precisely the expertise that [NBIS](//nbis.se) provides.

<dd>Fifth instance of the course, suitable for complete beginners and
  assumes no prior programming experience (beyond the ability to use a
  text editor). A very basic knowledge of UNIX is definitely an
  advantage, such as navigating through folders and issuing commands
  at a shell prompt. This year the course will be given online.
