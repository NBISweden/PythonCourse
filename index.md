[NBIS](//nbis.se) offers practical courses in [Python](//www.python.org/)
programming for the complete novice, to more advanced
users. Participants are lead through the core aspects of Python
illustrated by a series of example programs. Upon completion of the
course, attentive participants will be able to write simple Python
programs from scratch and to customize more complex code to fit their
needs.

> The craft of programming is about taking design decisions to avoid
> overwhelming complexity and permit easy maintenance over time,
> insuring reliability (which goes beyond debugging) and utilizing
> computer resources efficiently.
