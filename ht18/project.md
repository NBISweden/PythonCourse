<blockquote class="task">

<p data-mark="Background"><b>Background</b>: For many diseases with
known causative mutations, screening methods have been developed to
detect whether people have a high risk of becoming sick, even before
the onset of the actual disease.</p>

<p> Over the last few years, the cost of full genome sequencing has
gone down so that, in some cases, it might be cheaper to collect the
complete genome sequence of patients with a high risk of carrying
variants associated with the disease, rather than using targeted
screening procedures.</p>

<p> Cystic fibrosis is a complex disease, where patients often
manifest the following symptoms: problems with lung functions,
diabetes and infertility. From a genetic point of view, there are
several mutations associated with this disease. In particular, the
CFTR gene (short for Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance
Regulator) encodes an ion channel protein acting in epithelial cells,
and carries several non-synonymous genetic variants, with alterations
leading to premature stop codons, that are known to cause the
disease.</p>

<hr/>

<p data-mark="Goal"><b>Goal</b>: In this assignment, you have access
to the human reference genome as well as the genome annotation. In
addition, you have full genome sequence data from five individuals
from a family at risk of carrying mutations related to the
disease.</p>

<p> Your task is to write a Python program that will extract the correct transcript from the CFTR gene, translate the gene sequence to its corresponding amino-acid sequence and based on the reference amino-acid sequence determine whether any of the five given individuals is affected.</p>

# Fetch the appropriate files {#fetch-files}

The main task is divided in several steps. The first step is to fetch
the reference sequence file (in `fasta` format) and the appropriate reference annotation file (in `GTF` format) from the [Ensembl database](http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html).

The CTFR gene is located on chromosome `7`. After downloading the files, read up on how the files are structured.

Human reference DNA for chromosome 7 (fasta):
- Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna_sm.chromosome.7.fa.gz

Human GTF annotation file:
- Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.93.gtf.gz

Many of the tasks involves outputting long sequences. To make sure they are correct, use the <code>utils.check_answers</code> package:
<pre class="highlight"><code>from utils import check_answers</code></pre>

# Warmup {#warmup}

1. What is the length of chr7 on the reference sequence??

   <details>
   <summary>Tip</summary>
   <section>
   <p>Open the reference fasta file and read it line by line.</p>
   <p>Ignore the first line and, in a loop, get the length of each line (from which you remove the trailing newline character).</p>
   <p>Sum up all the lengths you found.</p>
   </section>
   </details>
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   <section>
   <p>Chromosome 7 has 159.345.973 base pairs.</p>
   </section>
   </details>


2. How many genes are annotated in the GTF file?

   <details>
   <summary>Tip</summary>
   <section>
   <p>You need to understand the structure of a GTF-formatted file.</p>
   <p>The GTF format uses several tab-delimited fields, for which we give you a <a href="https://github.com/NBISweden/PythonCourse/blob/ht18/assignment/data/gtf-format.md">short a description</a>.</p>
   <p>Alternatively, you can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_transfer_format">search online</a>.</p>
   <p>Then, only count entries of type gene</p>
   </section>
   </details>
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   <section>
   <p>There are 58.395 genes annotated in the GTF file</p>
   </section>
   </details>


# Architect a method {#method}

All the following tasks are now related to the CTFR gene.

In the annotation file (the GTF file), that gene has the
id `ENSG00000001626` on chromosome `7`.


1. How many transcripts can this gene generate?

   <details>
   <summary>Tip</summary>
   <section>
   <p>Again, think about the structure of the GTF file</p>
   </section>
   </details>
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   <section>This gene can produce 11 different transcripts</section>
   </details>

2. What is the longest transcript in nucleotides?

   <details>
   <summary>Tip</summary>
   <section>
   <p>Use start and stop positions for each transcript of the gene</p>
   </section>
   </details>
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   <section>
   <p>The transcript with id ENST00000003084 is the longest among 11 other transcripts, and spans 188.703 bases</p>
   </section>
   </details>

3. Fetch the DNA sequence for that transcript

   <details>
   <summary>Tip</summary>
   <section>
   <p>Similarly to step 1 from the Warmup, open the reference file.</p>
   <p>Ignore the first line and, in a loop, append each line to a list.</p>
   <p>Remember to strip the trailing newline character.</p>
   <p>Outside the loop, use the <code>join</code> function to concatenate the lines from the list.</p>
   <p><b>Avoid concatenation</b> <i>inside</i> the loop, as it is slow and wasting memory</p>
   <p>Use the start and stop positions extracted from the transcript, but think about where the index starts from</p>
   </section>
   </details>
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   <section>
   <p>Write your results to file and compare with <code>check_answers.ex3(resultsFile)</code> </p>

   </details>

4. Fetch all the exons for that transcript, spliced together to one sequence

   <details>
   <summary>Tip</summary>
   <section>
   <p>First you need to save the start and stop positions of all exons of that transcript.</p>

   <p>Check that the <code>start_codon</code> is <code>ATG</code>, and that the <code>stop_codon</code> corresponds to a proper stop codon</p>
   <p>Make your program print a warning message in case the transcript does not begin with a start-codon and end with a stop-codon</p>
   </section>
   </details>

# Find the patients at risk {#main-task}

We are reaching the goal for this assignment!

A mutation in the transcript ENST00000003084 causes a premature stop codon to be introduced into the aminoacid sequence. This creates a truncated protein, causing cystic fibrosis.
Using the python program you have designed above, compare the reference sequence to the sequences of the following 5 patients
([patient-1](https://github.com/NBISweden/PythonCourse/raw/ht18/assignment/data/Patient1.fa.gz),
[patient-2](https://github.com/NBISweden/PythonCourse/raw/ht18/assignment/data/Patient2.fa.gz),
[patient-3](https://github.com/NBISweden/PythonCourse/raw/ht18/assignment/data/Patient3.fa.gz),
[patient-4](https://github.com/NBISweden/PythonCourse/raw/ht18/assignment/data/Patient4.fa.gz),
and
[patient-5](https://github.com/NBISweden/PythonCourse/raw/ht18/assignment/data/Patient5.fa.gz))
to determine which one is carrying a mutation in the CFTR gene, causing a truncated protein.

There might be several.
