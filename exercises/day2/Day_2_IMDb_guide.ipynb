    "1. A good place to start is always to manually inspect the file in any text editor. Identify how the structure of the file is, what delimiters it's using, and which columns you are interested in.\n",
    "2. Open the file and loop over the lines. You can also print the lines, but be aware that the output might be huge, and potentiella crash your computer. The `break` statement is good, which if inserted after the `print` statement will break out of the loop after printing just one line.\n",
    "3. Isolate the column containing the rating (Think about what type it is also)\n",
    "4. So how do you find out which rating is the best? One option is to initiate a counter with the value 0 before the loop, and compare the rating to that one, and if it is better, replace it with that rating instead. After the loop that counter should contain the highest rating.\n",
    "5. To also save the name of the movie in your counter you can use a list as your counter, where the first item in your list is the name of the movie, and the second item is the rating. When comparing ratings you simple compare the current rating with the second item in your counter list."

So here we don't have to check if the item is in the set, we can just loop of the genre list and add the item to the set, and it will automatically make sure there are only one of each genre.\n",
