On this occation we compare chrom to '2' (a string). As chromosomes don't have to be integers (X,Y,M etc), this would make sense. The position on the other hand will always be an integer, so depending on the comparison you might have to change type. In this case it works, as we are interested in exact matches ('136608646' == '136608646' will always be true). However, if you would be looking for any position after this ('136608646' > '136608646'), that would not work. In that case you would have to change the type (int(pos) > 136608646)\n",
